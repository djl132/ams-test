//KEY CODE IS NOT CASE SENSITIVE.


//CHAR CODE

CHARCODE(CASE SENSITIVE) IS SET DURING A KEYPRESS EVENT.
charCode is never set in the keydown and keyup events. In these cases, keyCode is set instead.



In a keypress event, the Unicode value of the key pressed is stored in either the
keyCode or charCode property, never both.

If the key pressed generates a character
(e.g. 'a'), charCode is set to the code of that character, respecting the letter case.
(i.e. charCode takes into account whether the shift key is held down).

Otherwise, the
code of the pressed key is stored in keyCode.
